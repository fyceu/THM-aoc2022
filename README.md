Advent of Cyber is an event that gets people started in cyber security, by releasing beginner friendly security exercises every day leading up to Christmas.

Each task is self contained and includes the basic information required to start working on a security challenge - We won't be throwing you in the deep end, every challenge will contain supporting material and a video tutorial!
